## ✈️ Airlines Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores a comprehensive dataset of domestic flights in India, analyzing patterns in pricing, 
duration, airline frequency, and travel timings. Using Python and popular data visualization libraries, 
it uncovers key insights to help understand how various factors influence flight costs and availability.

## 📂 Dataset
• Source: airlines_flights_data.csv

• Rows: 300,153

•	Columns: 11

•	Features include: 

--	Airline name

--	Flight number

--	Source and destination cities

--	Departure and arrival times

--	Number of stops

--	Travel class

--	Duration

--	Days left to departure

--	Ticket price

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📊 Key Analyses
•	Airline Frequency: Bar chart showing flight counts per airline

•	Departure & Arrival Time Distribution: Visualized to reveal peak travel hours

•	Source vs Destination Cities: Comparative bar graphs

•	Price Variation by Airline: Mean ticket prices grouped by airline and class

•	Impact of Departure/Arrival Time on Price: Explored using groupby and plots

•	Extreme Cases: 

--	Longest flight duration: 49.83 hours (Air India, Chennai → Bangalore)

--	Highest ticket price: ₹1,23,071 (Vistara, Kolkata → Delhi)

--	Lowest ticket price: ₹1,105 (AirAsia, Chennai → Hyderabad)

## 📈 Visualizations
All plots are created using matplotlib and seaborn, including:
•	Horizontal bar charts

•	Grouped bar plots by class

•	Subplots for time-based comparisons

## 🔍 Insights
•	Vistara operates the most flights but also has the highest average ticket price.

•	Morning and Early Morning are the most common departure slots.

•	Ticket prices vary significantly by airline, class, and timing.

•	Flights with more stops tend to have longer durations and sometimes lower prices.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.	Clone the repository
2.	Ensure the dataset is placed correctly (airlines_flights_data.csv)
3.	Run the notebook or script in a Python environment with required libraries installed

## 📌 Future Enhancements
•	Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Power BI
